## Observations

- Accuracy: Hybrid search perfectly matched the most relevant document in all 15 queries, outperforming dense search which had 8 out of 15 exact matches.
- Relevance: Hybrid scores are consistently higher, reflecting more semantically aligned results.
- Latency: Dense search is faster, averaging 3.91 seconds compared to hybridâ€™s 6.25 seconds. A trade-off exists between precision and performance.

## Conclusion

Hybrid search delivers superior relevance and accuracy, especially for nuanced or multi-faceted queries, making it suitable for high-quality retrieval tasks. However, dense search offers faster response times and remains viable for time-sensitive applications.
